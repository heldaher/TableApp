//want to start with each user having value of not selected
//assume I should do this by add field newUser["selected"]
//which would be set to false and changed to true when selected
//then when row with user is selected, will change to true, whill unhide check
//then all users with mark of true will be included in new group
//as an array of users (so group will have an array field with all users)
//? - will there be a way to know that user belongs to a group?
//? - maybe each user should have a 'groups' field that is an array of groups
//and it would get appended to when a user selected...

//maybe user shouldn't accept group invitation but just be added to one?
//with opportunity to mute thread added later
//so this would mean less work - less coding, screens
//I think I'll do this
//reference or array?

//...so when a user is selected, boolean (though may be a string) is toggled
//need to set all back to false before exit method
//save newGroup
//with newGroup["users"] = [selectedUsers] as NSArray
//so will need to do a for in loop before toggling back to false where, when done is pressed:
//if user["isSelected"] = true { selectedUsers.append(user) }

//then when do timeline can say:
//do I want to loop thrugh every group and if user is in it then add group.posts to timeline sorted chron.?
//sounds problematic in that user model does not know on its own what group(s) it belongs to
//alternative is?
//have user have a user["groups"] field = NSArray of group objects
//once have this field stored in table then

//...will need to modify existing records by adding users to groups (at a later date?)

//then can loop through groups.posts of each user, store it in relevantPosts array, and sort and display
//so question here is how do I get this user["groups"] field?
//I guess when newGroup created, append to user.groups a new objects

//big question here though is: is this whole architecture wrong?
//shouldn't I be creating a reference? perhaps array of reference ids?
//note that child has a reference to the id of parent
//need to check one to one vs one to many differences - but I think store array of reference ids

//so next steps are:
//delete existing users and create new users (will have to create different users) that have:
//1) additional field of user["isSelected"] = false as NSString
//2) additional field of user["groups"] = [(reference id to a group)]
//i.e., array of CKReferences that will originally be empty

//then, add code to allow a selection option on the create group user row
//that when selected toggles value

//then when press done:
//newGroup is created
//has a name field
//has a users field - that is created by looping through users and when isSelected is true adding user to array
//then after adding to array isSelected field for that user is toggled back to false (already done)
//(note that group invitations is not currently in existence)
//(this would get very annoying if app grows and find self bombarded by posts from unwanted groups)
//(can revisit this later but for getting going ok to not have invitation functionality added)
//then newGroup (with name and array of member users) is saved

//basically now have to save group["users"] field
//create it by looping through user in users and when user["checked"] = "true", append to group["users"] array
//then save group
